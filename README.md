An ecommerce store restful API written in expressJS

### Initial Vision

A RESTful ecommerce engine.

The project is just starting out and it may or may not be in a unstable stage.
Continuous development is in progress and it may introduce some breaking changes in the build.

I'm working on an MVP for alpha release with core features of an ecommerce store.

This is project will only provide a RESTful engine, with 100% API backend only. Don't expect any front-end.
Front end portion will be separately developed to play with the engine.

Front end code will be written in seperate repositories as a progress web app or native apps.
In future you may see front end built in React, Angular, Vue.js, react-native, and native-script.
